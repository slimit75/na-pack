# NAPack
NAPack is a content pack for the [Immersive Vehicles](https://github.com/DonBruce64/MinecraftTransportSimulator) Minecraft mod. It's primary goal is to provide road signs that are as accurate to their North American counterparts as possible. As there are obviously many countries in North America, this pack currently only focuses on US road signs as published in the FHWA's [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_11th_Edition.htm) and [Standard Highway Signs](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno-shs_2024.htm) publications â€” other countries may be considered in the future.

### Other Software Used
* The build system is pretty much identical to that used by Immersive Vehicles
* The [Roadgeek](https://github.com/sammdot/roadgeek-fonts) fonts were used, their license is available to read [here](https://github.com/sammdot/roadgeek-fonts/blob/master/LICENSE).
* [Minecraft Unicode Font Generator](https://github.com/codehz/minecraft-unicode-font-generator) was used to convert the Roadgeek fonts into something usable for Minecraft.
